# My-First-Backend-project

Hi! this is my first backend project, I used Java, mySQL, some HTML, CSS and JS.

And this is a page which can let you register with an ID, name, lastname, and it can create a username and password.

It let you sign in, login and logout. 

Add authentication and authorization to your REST API. This could involve implementing user registration, login, and logout functionality, as well as restricting access to certain resources based on a user's role or permissions.
